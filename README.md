## Trails & angular configuration example Isomorphic Version. 

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/maissani/trails-angular2-isomorphic.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This package contains an out of the box authentication api using trails and trailpack-passport and authentication frontend with angular2 and anular-jwt .

## Why Isomorphism ?
When resources served to client ,they load after the client get the page, as usual with angular.
This example provide a server rendering for angular with TrailsJs with the capacity to render resources from the server when first loaded.
As soon as robots from Google and others need to fetch pages, the easy way is to serve them from server instead of generating them from phantomJS.
